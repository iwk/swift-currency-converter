# Project Information

This is a universal currency converter app developed for iPhone and iPad.

  - Project was created with Xcode Version 7.0.1 and Swift 2.1 (lastest versions).

  - Input number is formatted in realtime while user is editing the text field. It has to handle some special cases especially handling trailing characters. Details are writtern in test cases and comments.

  - To make the custom control(swiping currency control) reusable, colors are configurable in Interface Builder with IBInspectable. It uses IBDesignable to do live rendering in storyboard.

  - The input text field is cleared when user starts inputing numbers. Original number is restored if user cancels editing.

  - Checked Helvetica is one of the preinstalled fonts that come with iPhone/iPad since version 3/4. It should be ok.

  - It includes a project reference folder containing the original instructions in case the online version changes.
